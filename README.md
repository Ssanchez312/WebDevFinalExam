# Digital Closet Project

## Project Description
For my final project, I wanted to work on something that has to do with my hobbies and interests. I dont want to do something just for the grade, I wanted to work on something that I can truly be interested in. I decided to work on a digital Personal Closet web app, I want to be able to upload pictures of items in my wardrobe and save them to my website. After uploading my clothing items, I want to create outfits by selecting various items and use them in real life. 

On how it works: The user will be able to create a profile and upload pictures of the clothing items to their profile, these items should also be saved in their profile. For uploading, The user should be able to upload their picture, name the item, choose what it is (shirt, t shirt, jeans, shoes, etc.) and an optional description of the item. Once they have uploaded items, the user in the main page will see their items on the left and right of the page. The user will be able to click on the picture of the item and drag it in to the middle. Once the user is happy with their outfit, they will be able to save their outfit and edit it if necessary. 

I feel that this project joins my interests and my major in a very interesting way. If all goes well, I believe that I will be using the webpage even after finishing the project. I want to work further in to this even after the semester ends.

## Hard Things
### Main 25 Points
15pts: Back-end api (write your own in C# or node.js)
5pts: Host your html/css/javascript site on GitHub pages
15pts: Uploading, storing, and using files on a custom api

For these points, I plan to use a custom c# API for my backend, I have hosted pages on github before so It will be easy for me to host it and my webpage revolves around uploading, storing and using the pictures that the users upload to the site. So the most important thing is getting that to work

### Other 25 pts
5pts: Use a css styling framework (e.g. bootstrap or tailwind) (listLinks to an external site.)
8pts: Work with audio / video files in your app
10pts: Use static site generator (hugo, jekyll, etc.) for html and css for part of the site

For the other 25 points, If I can I would like to upload a tutorial video on how to use the virtual closet and put it on the webpage possibly as a pop up and have it play in the website. I will have to learn how to use a static site generator and a new css framework meanwhile working on the page.
